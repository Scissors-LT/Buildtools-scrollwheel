Tool for texturing minecraft walls by simulating an unlocked scrollwheel.


I also added a thing that lets you select certain parts of your hotbar to scroll through :)

without checking the 'use hotbar' box, it just scrolls down really fast. If you check that box it will press the numbers on your keyboard that you select in a random order really quickly.
